Software : The Temporal Logic Planning (TuLiP) Toolbox is a collection of Python-based code for automatic synthesis of correct-by-construction embedded control software as discussed in [FDLOM16]. This chapter contains a brief overview of the toolbox, along with instructions on how to install the software.

Though installation should be easy (and standardized) through setup.py, there are some dependencies that will need to be manually installed if not already available; details are provided in Installation. Note that this documentation is still under development.
